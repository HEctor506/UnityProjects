  dialogueLines:
  - Hi there!
  - Did you know mangroves are trees that grow between the land and the sea?
  - Good!!
  - They're disappearing... and with them, many animals too
  - They form special forests that live in salty water
  - They're unique and really important for many species
  - Would you like to know why they matter so much?
  - Mangroves protect the coast from strong waves and storms
  - They're home to fish, crabs, and even baby sharks!
  - Ohh.. I see. I though you wanted to make a change
  - Now I see, I was wrong, bye...
